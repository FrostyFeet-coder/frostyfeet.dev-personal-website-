Hey there, I'm **Ansh Wasan** 👋

I'm a backend developer and a 4th-year B.Tech student at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. This blog is where I share my learnings, experiences, and insights from my journey in software development.

## What I'll Be Writing About

My primary focus is **backend development**, so you can expect posts covering:

- **API Design & Development** - RESTful APIs, GraphQL, best practices
- **Database Systems** - SQL, NoSQL, query optimization, data modeling
- **System Design** - Scalability, microservices, distributed systems
- **DevOps Essentials** - Docker, CI/CD, deployment strategies
- **Backend Frameworks** - Spring Boot, Node.js, Django, and more

## Why Backend?

There's something incredibly satisfying about building the invisible infrastructure that powers applications. While users interact with beautiful frontends, it's the backend that handles the heavy lifting—processing data, managing authentication, ensuring security, and making everything work seamlessly.

## Beyond Backend

While backend is my forte, I also have experience in:
- Frontend development
- Web development
- Mobile application development

This gives me a holistic view of software architecture and helps me build better backend systems that integrate smoothly with frontends.

Stay tuned for more posts, and let's learn together! 🚀
